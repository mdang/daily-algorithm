- Algorithms are all around us, however something we don't give enough attention to are the algorithms that propel us forward in our daily lives.
- Your Daily Life Algorithm (DLA) is not every single task that you carry out everyday. It's the collection of tasks and steps you are guaranteed to take everyday without thinking. Essentially it's the habits that you have that shape your character and propel you toward your long-term goals without much thought.

An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task or solve a problem. Today we're going to optimize the algorithm you have for getting by in your day.

## Why Do I Care? (5 min)

- We're often times flying by the seat of our pants. A lot of our habits have been formed without much thought
- Habits are the foundation for our character. It's not one moment that will make you great, it's the sum of what you've done together that matter
- To reach our longer-term goals, it's rarely ever just "let me work for a week" and then suddenly it happens. Longer-term goals require advances through a long period of time, and you need to prepare for them through repetition and small steps forward.
- When you don't have something that you "have to do", what you end up is wasting time on debating whether you should do it or not. Decide up front what you "have to do" vs what's "nice to do".

## Your Daily Algorithm (15 min)

Before we can optimize our daily algorithm, we have to first understand what it is. Try to think about a typical day from the perspective of a 3rd party. What are the tasks you are guaranteed to spend time on any given day? Take a few moments to write down your thoughts somewhere, like on paper, a text editor, [Trello](https://trello.com/), etc. 

- I recommend not sharing it at first because it's easier to be brutally honest. This only works because you're being completely honest with yourself.
- Often times, we think about the time we spend in terms of what it "should" or "ideally" be. Reflect though and think about how much time you really spend on any of your daily activities.
- Let's focus on general activities and not the individual steps for those activities. For example, say "brushing teeth" and not break down the actual steps for brushing your teeth.

Here's an example of some generic tasks for a day: 

| Task | Time Spent |
| --- | --- |
| Sleep | 9 hours |
| Get out of bed | 1 hour |
| Get ready for work | 30 minutes |
| Travel to work | 45 minutes |
| Work | 8 hours |
| Check Facebook | 1 hour |
| Check Instagram | 30 minutes |
| Lunch | 1 hour |
| Travel from work | 45 minutes |
| TV | 2 hours |
| Dinner | 1 hour |
| Shower | 30 minutes |

## Optimize! (15 min)

### Do Better with Current Tasks

Now it's the fun part. Let's optimize our day and feel good about how we're living. 

Add in the actual expected time for your each task now. Don't put in a time that's unrealistic. Be honest and realistic with the improved time. Some tasks are a set amount of time, for example don't suddenly turn an 8 hour work day into 7 for the sake of optimization. It's perfectly reasonable though if you're overworked and doing 12 hour work days.  

### Work Toward Long Term Goals

Take time to think through the other goals in your life, like staying in touch with friends and family. Add tasks that you can do to better your life in those areas. For example, once a day you might reach out to a loved one and connect. You might wish that you read more. In that case, set aside time and begin your new habit. 

The example below builds upon the previous sample for current tasks.

| Task | Time Spent | Ideal Time Spent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sleep | 9 hours | 8 hours |
| Get out of bed | 1 hour | 5 minutes |
| Get ready for work | 30 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Travel to work | 45 minutes | 45 minutes |
| Work | 8 hours | 8 hours |
| Check Facebook | 1 hour | 15 minutes |
| Check Instagram | 30 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Lunch | 1 hour | 30 minutes |
| Travel from work | 45 minutes | 45 minutes
| TV | 2 hours | 30 minutes |
| Dinner | 1 hour | 30 minutes |
| Call family | - | 15 minutes |
| Reach out to a friend | - | 15 minutes |
| Shower | 30 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Read | - | 30 minutes |

## Visualize and Revise (15 min)

Try out the [Daily Algorithm Visualizer](https://mdang.github.io/daily-algorithm/) that accompanies this document which helps you visualize your day and how you spend it in regards to time.

Enter each of the tasks from the *optimized* day you have planned. The app will help you visualize the amount of free time you have in an average day and helps you understand where you're spending time that you probably shouldn't be.

## Bonus

### Weekly Algorithm

Now that we have our Daily Algorithm, we can use that to formulate our weekly habits as well. Try not to go beyond a week because often times a month is just too long of a period of time to grasp conceptually and can vary quite a bit. A week still allows us to see the connection to longer-term goals while still allowing us to prioritize for the current daily activities in the week.
