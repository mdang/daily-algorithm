- Algorithms are all around us, however something we don't give enough attention to are the algorithms that propel us forward in our daily lives. 
- Your Daily Life Algorithm (DLA) is not every single task that you carry out everyday. It's the collection of tasks and steps you are guaranteed to take everyday without thinking. Essentially it's the habits that you have that shape your character and propel you toward your long-term goals without much thought. 


An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task or solve a problem. Today we're going to optimize the algorithm you have for getting by in your day. 

## Why Do I Care?

- We're often times flying by the seat of our pants. A lot of our habits have been formed without much thought 
- Habits are the foundation for our character. It's not one moment that will make you great, it's the sum of what you've done together that matter 
- To reach our longer-term goals, it's rarely ever just "let me work for a week" and then suddenly it happens. Longer-term goals require advances through a long period of time, and you need to prepare for them through repetition and small steps forward. 
- When you don't have something that you "have to do", what you end up is wasting time on debating whether you should do it or not. Decide up front what you "have to do" vs what's "nice to do".

## Your Daily Algorithm Today

Before we can optimize our algorithm, we have to first acknowledge what it is now. 

- Create private repo or open up your text editor. I recommend not sharing it at first because it's easier to be brutally honest. This only works because you're being completely honest with yourself. 
- Often times, we think about the time we spend in terms of what it "should" or "ideally" be. Reflect though and think about how much time you really spend on any of your daily activities. 
- Let's focus on general activities and not the individual steps for those activities. For example, say "brushing teeth" and not break down the actual steps for brushing your teeth. 

```
function getDailyAlgorithm() {
	const steps = [];
	steps.push({
		task: 'get out of bed',
		expectedMinutes: 1,
		actualMinutes: 20 
	});
	steps.push({
		task: 'brush teeth',
		expectedMinutes: 2,
		actualMinutes: 2
	});
	steps.push({
		task: 'wash face',
		expectedMinutes: 1,
		actualMinutes: 1
	});
	steps.push({
		task: 'sleep',
		expectedMinutes: 60 * 8,
		actualMinutes: 60 * 7
	});
}

```

## Optimizing Your Daily Life Algorithm

- Let's add in the actual expected time for your each task now. Don't put in a time that's unrealistic. Be honest about what you would want it to be. 

Take time to think through the other goals in your life, like staying in touch with friends and family. Add tasks that you can do to better your life in those areas. For example, once a week you will call a friend to catch up. 

## Weekly Life Algorithm 

- Now that we have our DLA, we can use that to formulate our weekly habits. I don't recommend anything beyond a week because often times a month is just too long of a period of time to get a hold of and often varies too much. A week allows us to see the connection to longer-term goals while still allowing us to prioritize for the current daily activities in the week.
